# Mixtape Player Tests

This file describes the manual tests to verify the BottomPlayerBar functionality.

## Why Manual Tests?

We're using manual tests for audio functionality because:

1. **Browser Audio API Limitations**: The HTML5 Audio API has features that don't work well in test environments like JSDOM.
2. **User Interaction**: Some audio behaviors only work properly with genuine user interaction due to browser security policies.
3. **Visual Feedback**: It's important to visually confirm that the UI components (play/pause buttons, slider, time display) sync correctly with audio playback.

These tests help verify that the audio player works as expected in a real browser environment.

## Test 1: Play/Pause Functionality

**Goal**: Verify that music playback can be started, stopped, and restarted.

**Steps**:

1. Load the application
2. Click on a track to select it
3. Click the play button in the player bar at the bottom
4. Verify that music starts playing
5. Click the pause button
6. Verify that music stops playing
7. Click the play button again
8. Verify that music continues from where it left off

**Expected Result**: The player should reliably play and pause audio, and resume from the paused position.

## Test 2: Progress Slider Functionality

**Goal**: Verify that the slider shows playback progress and can be used to seek.

**Steps**:

1. Play a track and wait a few seconds
2. Observe the slider moving as the track plays
3. Click and drag the slider to a new position
4. Verify that the playback jumps to that position
5. Continue playback from the new position

**Expected Result**: The slider should accurately reflect the current playback position and allow jumping to different parts of the track.

## Test 3: Duration Display

**Goal**: Verify that the track duration is displayed correctly.

**Steps**:

1. Select different tracks and observe the duration display
2. Check that the format is MM:SS (e.g., 3:45)
3. Verify that the duration shown matches the actual track length

**Expected Result**: The player should show the correct total duration for each track, not 0:00.

## Other Checks

- **Format**: All times should be displayed in MM:SS format (e.g., 3:45)
- **Progress**: The current time should update smoothly during playback
- **Responsiveness**: Controls should be responsive with minimal delay
- **Edge Cases**: Test with very short tracks and very long tracks

## Issues Fixed

- [x] Play button now properly starts playback
- [x] Pause button now properly stops playback
- [x] Play after pause now works correctly
- [x] Progress slider moves during playback
- [x] Seeking with the slider jumps to the correct position
- [x] Duration is shown correctly, not 0:00

## Implementation Details

The implementation fixes these issues through:

1. **Proper Audio Lifecycle Management**:

   - Reset state when track changes
   - Cleanup audio element when unmounting
   - Handle play/pause with promise-based API

2. **Better Metadata Handling**:

   - Use track's ID3 duration data as fallback
   - Properly handle audio metadata load events
   - Show loading state until duration is available

3. **Error Recovery**:

   - Handle play failures gracefully
   - Reset UI state when errors occur
   - Provide user feedback during loading/errors

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Cancel stale operations when track changes
   - Properly cleanup resources
